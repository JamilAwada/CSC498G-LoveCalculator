### Assignment 2

## A fun app for when love is in the air
Us developers rarely manage the time to go out on dates and meet new people, but who cares? We have our precious programming languages, which surely won't wake up one day and tell
you that they don't love you anymore.

## How compatible are we?
Forget dating shows, this application will accurately tell you just how compatible you are with your favorite programming language, and whether or not you should put a ring on it.

## And remember to stay faithful, even if C hasn't been the best of partners.
